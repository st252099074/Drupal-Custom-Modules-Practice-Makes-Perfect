# Subscribing to an event requires you to create a new service tagged with the
# 'event_subscriber' tag. This tells the service container, and by proxy the
# event dispatcher service, that the class registered here can be queried to get
# a list of events that it would like to be notified about.
services:
  # Give your service a unique name, convention is to prefix service names with
  # the name of the module that implements them.
